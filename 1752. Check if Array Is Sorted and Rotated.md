# Checking if an Array is Sorted and Rotated


> problem link : https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/
## Understanding the Problem

An array is **sorted and rotated** if:

- It was initially sorted in **non-decreasing order** (ascending order, with possible duplicates).
- It was rotated some number of times (including 0 times).
- If we traverse the array, the order should break at **most once**.

---

## Example of a Valid Sorted and Rotated Array

- Only **one break** occurs at `5 → 1` (valid rotation).

### Example of an Invalid Array

| Array | Breaks At |
| --- | --- |
| [2, 1, 3, 4] | `2 → 1` and `3 → 4` (two breaks, invalid) |

---

## Explanation of Code

### C++ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        int countBreaks = 0;  // Counts how many times the order breaks
        int n = nums.size();

        // Loop through the array and count breaks in sorting order
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {  // If order breaks
                countBreaks++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the last element is greater than the first element
        // This ensures that the rotation is valid
        if (nums[n - 1] > nums[0]) {
            countBreaks++;
        }

        // If the order breaks at most once, it's a sorted rotated array
        return countBreaks <= 1;
    }
};

```

---

## Step-by-Step Breakdown of Code

### 1. Count Order Breaks

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {  // If a smaller number comes after a bigger one
        countBreaks++;
    }
}

```

- This loop traverses the array and counts how many times a **smaller number follows a larger one**.
- If this happens **more than once**, the array is **not a rotated sorted array**.

### 2. Check Last and First Element

```cpp
if (nums[n - 1] > nums[0]) {
    countBreaks++;
}

```

- Ensures the rotation is valid.

### Example where this check matters:

| Array | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] | Last element `2` is **not greater** than first element `3` (valid rotation) |

### 3. Final Condition

```cpp
return countBreaks <= 1;

```

- If the **order breaks at most once**, return `true` (valid sorted rotated array).
- If the **order breaks more than once**, return `false`.

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1: Valid Sorted Rotated Array

### Input:

```cpp
nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

```

| Index | nums[i-1] | nums[i] | nums[i] < nums[i-1]? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 4 | No |
| 2 | 4 | 5 | No |
| 3 | 5 | 1 | Yes (break count = 1) |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | No |

### Last-First Check:

- `nums[4] = 2` is **not greater** than `nums[0] = 3`, so **no extra count**.

**Total Breaks = 1 → Valid Sorted Rotated Array**

### Output:

```cpp
true

```

---

### Example 2: Invalid Sorted Rotated Array

### Input:

```cpp
nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]

```

| Index | nums[i-1] | nums[i] | nums[i] < nums[i-1]? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 1 | Yes (break count = 1) |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | No |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | No |

### Last-First Check:

- `nums[3] = 4` is **greater** than `nums[0] = 2`, so we **add one more break (count = 2)**.

**Total Breaks = 2 → Not a valid rotated sorted array**

### Output:

```cpp
false

```

## Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) (One pass through the array) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) (Only a few integer variables used) |

---

## Summary

| Concept | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Method** | Count breaks in order using a loop |
| **Key Check** | Last element should not be greater than the first |
| **Valid Condition** | `countBreaks ≤ 1` |
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) (One pass through the array) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) (Only a few variables) |

---

## Final Takeaway

- If the **array order breaks more than once**, it's **not** a valid rotated sorted array.
- The **last element should not be greater than the first** to validate rotation.
- The **single loop approach makes it efficient** (O(n)).
